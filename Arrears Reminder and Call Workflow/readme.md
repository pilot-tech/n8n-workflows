## üöÄ Installing n8n

You can install and run n8n either using **npx** or **Docker**.

### Option 1: Install via NPX (local machine)

```bash
npx n8n
```

> This starts n8n locally on [http://localhost:5678](http://localhost:5678)

### Option 2: Run with Docker

Create a simple `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3.1'

services:
  n8n:
    image: n8nio/n8n
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 5678:5678
    environment:
      - N8N_BASIC_AUTH_ACTIVE=true
      - N8N_BASIC_AUTH_USER=<your_user>
      - N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=<your_password>
    volumes:
      - ./n8n:/home/node/.n8n
```

Start with:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Then access it via [http://localhost:5678](http://localhost:5678)

## üîë Credential Setup

### 1. OpenAI API

Create an OpenAI credential in n8n using your API key:

üëâ [OpenAI Credential Setup](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/openai/)

Ensure you've selected the correct model (e.g., `gpt-4`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`, etc.) in the workflow.

### 2. vAPI Account

Set up your vAPI credentials for voice AI calls:

1. Create a vAPI account at [vapi.ai](https://vapi.ai)
2. Generate API key from your dashboard
3. Configure webhook endpoints for call completion callbacks
4. Add vAPI credentials to n8n as HTTP Header Auth

### 3. Email Service Setup

#### Gmail OAuth

Follow the official guide to set up Gmail credentials:

üëâ [Gmail OAuth Setup Guide](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/oauth-single-service/)

 
### 4. Google Sheets API

## üîÑ Workflow Overview

### 1. Payment Reminder and Call Trigger

**Webhook Trigger**
- Receives customer payment data from your billing system
- Processes customer information, payment status, and due dates

**Decision Logic**
- Checks due dates and overdue status
- Determines appropriate action based on payment stage

**Email Notifications**
- **Gentle reminder** (2 days before due)
- **Overdue notice** (on due date)
- **Final notice** (after due date)

**Voice AI Call Trigger**
- Activates if emails don't resolve the payment
- Initiates vAPI call with customer context

### 2. Post-Call Analysis and Follow-Up

**vAPI Webhook Processing**
- Receives call completion data from vAPI
- Processes call duration, status, and transcript

**AI Analysis**
- Extracts actionable insights from conversation transcripts
- Identifies customer intent and payment commitments
- Generates recommended follow-up actions

**Automated Actions**
- Send payment links via email/SMS
- Update Google Sheets tracking data
- Schedule additional follow-ups based on AI analysis
- Create calendar reminders for staff

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Webhook not receiving data**
   - Verify webhook URL configuration
   - Check n8n instance accessibility
   - Validate incoming data format

2. **vAPI calls not triggering**
   - Confirm vAPI API key is valid
   - Check webhook configuration
   - Verify phone number format

3. **Email delivery failures**
   - Check email service credentials
   - Verify recipient email addresses
   - Monitor spam/bounce rates

### Testing

Before going live:

1. Test webhook with sample data
2. Send test emails to verify delivery
3. Make test vAPI calls
4. Verify Google Sheets updates
5. Test AI analysis with sample transcripts
